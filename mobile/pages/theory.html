        Theory clock is inspired and designed by strong principles of Bauhaus aesthetics.
        <br />The clock is designed in simple and clear 3-dimensionality in order to give more attention to 4th dimension - known as time.
        <br />
        <br /> The clock hands are coated with styrofoam and painted while flat background could be made from various materials. Its edges shows values of 2, 4, 8 and 10 o'clock.
