        Origamy is a furniture case study inspired by origami folding principles that are applied on designing various objects out of a single sheet of metal.<br />
The goal was to develop range of metal products that look like over-sized paper creations, feel very lightweight and very stable by adding inner structural support without compromising its appearance.<br />
Such unconventional production technique was used to develop a range of furniture and household objects by giving interior modern and very minimalist look.<br />
Although made just for presentations such objects can be easily adjusted for very efficient mass production with minimal production waste and recyclability in mind.
