        Origamy is collection of products and furniture developed on origami folding principles. Special manufacturing technique is used to make each object out of single rectangular sheet of metal. Its minimalist style allows to be easily customized with patterns for different markets and even by users themselves. Innovative folding metal technique uses molds that bands metal sheet through multiple stages allowing furniture to be polished, perforated or coated with different finishes and graphics. Certain parts are added and welded to achieve structural stability without interupting overall aesthetics that is achieved through geometrical simplicity and harmony.
