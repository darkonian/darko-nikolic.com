    Oxi-gen is a case study focused on production simplicity, efficiency and transport.<br />
Different panel materials can be produced with different CNC production processes for easy transport, assembly and disassembly without tools.<br />
Design itself is suitable for exhibitions, fairs and presentations as it is very customizable and compact to transport when disassembled.<br />
Produced at very low tolerances all furniture pieces should stick together firmly after the assembly.<br />
Design pieces featured here are displayed in transparent material to highlight its geometry and simplicity.
