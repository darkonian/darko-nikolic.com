    8 skateboard tool is designed to be the smallest and most ergonomic skateboard adjustment tool. Because of its shape, small size and weight,
    <br /> it allows to be stored in average stash pocket while skateboarding and to easy and fast adjust skateboard when necessary.
    <br /> The double inbus key allows easier replacement of the board than with any other tool available on market and keeps the hardware perfectly aligned.
    <br /> It has also two phillips extensions that are stored inside for different types of standardized skateboard hardware.
